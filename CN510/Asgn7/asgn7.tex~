{\bf The Outstar Network}
\bigskip

This week we are modelling an Outstar Network with three border cells. We supply each border cell with a distinct inputs $I$ and will comment on how the pattern of inputs is stored across the system as a whole. 

\vspace{2mm}

The network is described by one source cell and several sink (or border cells); the relative strength of our input $I$ to border cell $i$ determines the synaptic weight between that border cell and the source cell. The source cell recieves an input, and behaves following the equation

\begin{equation}
  \frac{dx_o}{dt} = -A_0x_0+I_0
\end{equation}

The border cells behave as

\begin{equation}
  \frac{dx_i}{dt} = -Ax_i+B[x_0(t-\tau) - \Gamma]_+w_{0i} + I_i
\end{equation}

And their synaptic weights behave as

\begin{equation}
  \frac{dw_{0i}}{dt} = -Cw_{0i}+D[x_o(t-\tau)-\Gamma]_+x_i
\end{equation}

{\bf Analysis}
\bigskip

In order to analyze the long term behavior of our equations, let's define some terms. Our source sampling signal, which controls how and when our border cells recieve input from the source cell, can be written as follows:

\begin{equation}
  S_0(t) = [x_0(t-\tau)-\Gamma]_+
\end{equation}

The little plus sign means we are taking the maximum value between the value within the brackets and zero, or in other words ensuring the value is greater than or equal to zero. We can also solve our differential equation for the source cell using methods that have stood the test of time; doing so, we see that

\begin{equation}
  x_0(t) = \frac{I_0}{A_0}(1-e^{-A_ot})
\end{equation}

Once our sampling signal $S_0(t)$ becomes positive, we can solve for the equilibrium solutions of our border cell activations and synaptic weights by setting their rates of change equal to zero:

\begin{equation}
  -Ax_i+BS_0(t)w_{0i} + I_i = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  -Cw_{0i}+DS_0(t)x_i = 0
\end{equation}

This is a system of two equations with two unknowns; solving for one variable in terms of the other and plugging back in, we find that

\begin{equation}
  x_i=\frac{CI_i}{CA-BDS_o(t)^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  w_{0i}=\frac{DI_i}{A-BDS_o(t)}
\end{equation}

The first thing to note here is that the long term behavior of our sampling signal $S_0(t)$ will be 

\begin{equation}
  S_{0eq}(t) = \frac{I_0}{A_0} - \Gamma
\end{equation}

The second thing is that we are asked to determine, and will generally be concerned with, the behavior of the pattern variables representing weight and activation rather than these variables themselves. I have not solved for the pattern variables, but what I have solved for should be indicative of their overall behavior. 

\vspace{2mm}

The pattern variables of our system should tell what the activations and synaptic weights of our border cells should be relative to one another; noting that in both the weight and activaton expressions the only variable that really changes from border cell to border cell is the input $I_i$, we can conclude that the long term behavior of our pattern variables for both the activations and their weights should be proportional to, if not equal to, the pattern variable representing our input $I_i$. 

\vspace{2mm}

Therefore, the equilibrium values of our pattern variables for the weight and activation of our border cells should bear a strong resemblance to the pattern variables of our input pattern $I_i$. We will now run a computational simulation to see whether or not this is the case.
